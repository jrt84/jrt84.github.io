               <p> First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio.<br>
                I'd like to introduce myself, my name is Jourden Toliver. I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh.<br>
                I am interested in User Experience Design/Research.  Pitt offers a limited amount of User Experience-related classes so I spent my last year focusing on taking web design classes. I've taken User Centered Design and a CS Web Design and Development Course.<br>
                For my Capstone I took Web Programming. It was primarily focused on PHP, but we also used HTML, CSS, javascript, and SQL. <br>
                I wanted to make a portfolio site where I could better display the projects I've worked on over the last year. </p>

                    <li><a href="cs0134.html">Web Design and Development Final Project</a>: where I re-designed my school's observatory website.</li><br>
                    <li><a href="programming.html">Web Programming Final Project</a>: where I designed a website for a store that offers mobile pickup orders. <br>Included is a registration system, emulated checkout process, and a comment system made with PHP and sql. </li><br>

            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm 23 years old, born and raised here in Pittsburgh.<br>
            Growing up I was involved in art club for many years. Art is something I really enjoy and is actually what inspired me to become an IS major.<br>
             What really drew me to web design was the impact of visuals. <br> When browsing websites, the design isn't something most people think about in their day-to-day lives, but it's there and it's impacting their experience, whether they know it or not. I personally find that aspect of web design intriguing.</p>
