                    <p class= "about-text"> The Allegheny Observatory was born February 15, 1859 when three citizens of Allegheny City met at the office of Professor Lewis Bradley to consider the purchase of a telescope, "the magnifying power of which would bring the heavenly bodies near enough to be viewed with greater interest and satisfaction". These men and 29 others later formed the Allegheny Telescope Association.</p><br>

It is the third largest refractor in the United States and was constructed by the Brashear Co. <br><br>The second largest dome of the Allegheny Observatory houses the James E. Keeler Memorial Telescope. The Keeler Memorial is a reflecting telescope with a mirror 31 inches in diameter.</p>
