        <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: 20px; width:90%; margin: auto;"> For User Centered Design we had a semester long group project. It was probably my hardest group project since there was lack of communication between the groupmembers, but we eventually pulled through.<br>
        At the beginning of the semester, we did an assignment where we created personas. <br>For my group, we were assigned a site for a store called Toolin' Around. They were a hardware store that got new owners that wanted to revamp and add some community features like a workshop, a tool library, etc. <br><br>
        Our next assignment was to create wireframes first by sketch, and then using balsamiq and from there we did our midterm which consisted of making our mockups and prototypes using Figma, which is available below: </p><br><br>

        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; font-size: 20px; padding-top: 20px; width:90%; margin: auto;"> We tried to go with a simple layout. We used many shades of blue. We found that research shows that lighter shades of blue evoke feelings of calmness, friendliness, and trust-which we thought were all important emotions when it came to dealing with the older customers and also attracting new ones. <br> We also felt that blue looked professional and fitting for a a hardware store. <br><br> For our final project we had to actually code our responsive pages which can be seen <a target="_blank" href="http://pitt.edu/~meh185/1052/Final/Home.html">here</a>. </p>
