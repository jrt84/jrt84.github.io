        <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: 20px; width:90%; margin: auto;">For this class we had a semester long solo project. We focused on four planning stages. The first part was targeting who our users were. The second assignment was creating a sitemap. The third was wireframing, and the fourth was coding it out.
           <br><br> For my assignment, I decided to re-design my professor's astronomy website. It's the official website for the Allegheny Observatory and it hasn't been updated in years.<br><br>

        <div class="csdiv" style="width: 100%;"class="comparison">
        <img alt="observatory website screenshot" style="width:50%;" src="U.png">
        <img alt="my observatory website remodel screenshot" style="width:50%;"src="Untitled%20design%20(1).png">
        </div>
        <br><br> <p style="font-size: 20px; padding-top: 20px; width:90%; margin: auto;"> <br><br>
The original website (left) is obviously old and I found that some of the links led to blank pages and some led to pages with data that was no longer relevant or could have been added to an existing page. <br>
My goal was to minimize the useless data and modernize the site, formatting it in a way that Pitt students were sure to recognize.<br>
Something I did have to keep in mind was that there were others using the site as well besides us astronomy students, like anyone interested in making a reservation and visiting the observatory. <br> <br>
To accommodate for those who may not be tech savvy, I designed the site in a straightforward style, cutting out any unnecessary content, making the text large and readable, and tried to follow the 60-30-10 rule to balance it out.<br>
I also added little blurbs from the most visited links onto the homepage so users wonâ€™t have to look long to find information about something like tour dates.
