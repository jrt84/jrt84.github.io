        <p> BACKGROUND
There are almost 40,000 students attending the University of Pittsburgh. Some of these students are traditional students while others may be graduate students, or students returning to school part- and sometimes full-time, but regardless of the individual’s situation, student’s have a lot to juggle. With homework, project due dates, exams, work schedules, extra-curricular and personal activities going on in their lives, it’s a lot to manage.
Our goal is to work with the university to develop an app that will lessen this burden and help students manage their time.
<br><br>

PROCESS
We began with interviewing students to add statistics and anecdotes into our concept design and requirements document. For this I tried to focus on asking open-ended questions so I didn't have to keep asking "why?" or needing them to elaborate. I wanted stories and experience to incorporate into my documents.
For my solo concept design I made a proposal for an app called The SchedUlizer. <br>
The SchedUlizer’s aim was to be a calendar app that acts primarily as a reliable notifying system that students of all ages and walks of life can grow to depend on.
Reliable as in it's synced with Blackboard so all assignments and due dates were on there, and also reliable in that it was meant to be very notification based.. To the point that it'd be annoying.<br><br>

After turning in our concept designs, we were put into groups, we compiled all of our interviews and created personas and made a requirements document. <br>
After this assignment we created user stories out of the interview data and built a User Experience Model. <br>
Something we all had in common in our interviews was that students wanted something where very little work had to be done on their end. So we tried to implement that with a Blackboard-integrated app called Xen. The idea was that everything automatically syncs from Blackboard, your email calendar, and the user's phone calendar. For the design, we wanted to make an interface where users could scroll and see all of their daily tasks, rather than having to click through multiple pages to navigate the app.

ROLE
There were three roles in each group: writer, designer, and presenter. I chose designing because that's what I'm most interested in. So I sketched out some wireframes and then created high-fidelity frames for our presentation.
